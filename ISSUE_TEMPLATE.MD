* Modal tells the user what dataset is being deleted, like “You are about to delete this dataset: car_crashes_2014.”
* A temporary "Trashcan" where you can recover a just deleted dataset if you mess up (maybe it's only good for a few hours, and then it cleans the cache assuming you made the right decision).
